                                    <p>We offer a no-charge consultation to discuss your project and provide a price
                                        estimate under no obligation. We invite you to take advantage of our years of
                                        experience to explore the possibilities for your space.</p>

                                    <h4>Custom Design</h4>
                                    <p>Once we have all the necessary information, we can provide a formal proposal with
                                        detailed costs and a timetable. If you are ready to move ahead with the project,
                                        we request 10% of the payment to lock a slot in our calendar. We then schedule a
                                        follow-up to set about creating your unique design and discuss the particulars
                                        of your project.</p>

                                    <p>We present 3D rendering drawings, photos, and/or sample materials. When you are
                                        happy with the final design, we are ready to build. Shortly before building
                                        begins, we require a 70% payment towards the construction of your project,
                                        including ordering materials. We craft your piece(s) in our Brooklyn studio.</p>

                                    <h4> Delivery & Installation </h4>
                                    <p>The majority of construction takes place in our studio; this minimizes the amount
                                        of time for installations so that there is as little disruption to your home as
                                        possible. All installation is done by our own crafts people who are trained to
                                        make sure installation is done precisely. </p>
